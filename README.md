# Computacenter DevOps Workshop

## Summary
DevOps Workshop Platform Infrastructure as Code 

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub discussions, or DM me on the twitter @rbocchinfuso._

#### Why
Developing a DevOps Workshop platform and curriculum.



## Requirements

- Docker
- Python 3 and pip
- docker-compose >= 1.28.6
- docker-compose-expand >= 0.1.0



## Env Deployment

- Download code from GitHub

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/CC-Digital-Innovation/devops-workshop.git
  ```

  _Note:  If you don't have Git installed you can also just grab the zip:
  [https://github.com/CC-Digital-Innovation/devops-workshop/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/CC-Digital-Innovation/devops-workshop/archive/master.zip)_

- Make any required changes to the docker-compose-expand.yml files in the ./devops-workshop/workshop-user-envs and ./devops-workshop/fake-switches directory

- Launch fake switch containers 

  ```
  cd ./devops-workshop/fake-switches
  docker-compose-expand up -d --build
  ```
  
- Launch required user env containers, and shared git and Jenkins containers

  ```
  cd ./devops-workshop/workshop-user-envs
  docker-compose-expand up -d --build
  ```

- Check that user envs, fake switches, git and Jenkins containers are running

  ```
  docker ps
  ```

## Configuration

- Setup user envs

  ```
  cd ./devops-workshop/config
  chmod 755 setup.sh
  sh -x ./setup.sh
  ```

  _The above Adds .ansible.cfg and simple ansible switch config playbook to each user env._



## Usage

- Access the user cloud dev environment

  ```
  http://url:8000
  ```

  - The included _docker-compose-expand.yml_ file deploys eleven (11) users envs on port 8000 - 8010.
  - The default user env password configured in _docker-compose-expand.yml_ is "workshop"
  - The default sudo password configure in the  _docker-compose-expand.yml_ file is "root"

- SSH to fake switch form your user env

  ```
  ssh root@hostname -p 2200
  ```

  - The included _docker-compose-expand.yml_ file deploys eleven (11) switches on port 2200 - 2210.
  - The default username configured in _docker-compose-expand.yml_ is "root"
  - The default password configure in the  _docker-compose-expand.yml_ file is "root"

- Play with the example Ansible playbook

  - Launch Terminal from cloud dev env (Ctrl+Shift+`)

  ```
  cd ~/workspace/switch-ansible-example
  ansible-playbook --list-hosts -i inventory example-playbook.yml
  ansible-playbook -i inventory example-playbook.yml
  ```



## To Do

- Configure Gitea
- Configure Jenkins
- Connect the E2E pipeline
- Build lap scenarios
- Add cAdvisor, Prometheus and Grafana for observability
