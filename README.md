# Computacenter DevOps Workshop

## Summary

DevOps Workshop Platform Infrastructure as Code

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub discussions, or DM me on the twitter @rbocchinfuso._

### Why

Developing a DevOps Workshop platform and curriculum.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Python 3 and pip
- docker-compose >= 1.28.6
- ~~docker-compose-expand >= 0.1.0~~
  - **DEPRECATED.** Replaced by build control scripts.

## Env Deployment

- Download code from GitHub

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/CC-Digital-Innovation/devops-workshop.git
  ```

  _Note: If you don't have Git installed you can also just grab the zip:
  [https://github.com/CC-Digital-Innovation/devops-workshop/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/CC-Digital-Innovation/devops-workshop/archive/master.zip)_

### **_DEPRECATED_**

~~- Make any required changes to the docker-compose-expand.yml files in the ./devops-workshop/workshop-user-envs and ./devops-workshop/fake-switches directory~~

- ~~Launch fake switch containers~~

  ```bash
  cd ./devops-workshop/fake-switches
  docker-compose-expand up -d --build
  ```

- ~~Launch required user env containers, and shared git and Jenkins containers~~

  ```bash
  cd ./devops-workshop/workshop-user-envs
  docker-compose-expand up -d --build
  ```

## Build Process Now Controlled by Control Scripts

- **./control-scripts/build.sh**: Rebuild entire DevOps Workshop environment
  - **WARNING: DESTRUCTIVE ACTION**
- **./control-scripts/down.sh**: Shuts down the DevOps Workshop environment
  - INFO: No data loss
- **./control-scripts/up.sh**: Stats up the DevOps Workshop environment
  - INFO: Data is persistent
- **./control-scripts/init.sh**: Reinitialize all WorkShop user environments
  - **WARNING: DESTRUCTIVE ACTION**
  - INFO: Significantly faster han build.sh because the containers are not rebuilt
- **./control-scripts/nuke.sh**: Cleans up all containers

  - **WARNING: DESTRUCTIVE ACTION**

- Check that user envs, fake switches, git and Jenkins containers are running

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

## Configuration

- ~~Setup user envs~~

  - **DEPRECATED.** Now handled by build control scripts.

    ```bash
    cd ./devops-workshop/config
    chmod 755 setup.sh
    sh -x ./setup.sh
    ```

  _The above Adds .ansible.cfg and simple ansible switch config playbook to each user env._

## Usage

- Access the user cloud dev environment

  ```http
  http://user1.quokka.ninja
  ```

  - ~~ The included _docker-compose-expand.yml_ file deploys eleven (10) users envs on port 8000 - 8010.~~
  - Ten user environments are deployed and registerd with Nginx reverse proxy. Environments are accessible using the url(s) http://user[1 to 10].quokka.ninja
  - ~~The default user env password configured in _docker-compose-expand.yml_ is "workshop"~~
  - The default user env password is "workshop"
  - ~~The default sudo password configure in the _docker-compose-expand.yml_ file is "root"~~
  - The default sudo password configure is "root"
  -

- SSH to fake switch form your user env

  ```bash
  ssh root@hostname -p 2200
  ```

  - ~~The included _docker-compose-expand.yml_ file deploys eleven (11) switches on port 2200 - 2210.~~
  - There are ten (10) deployed switched available on ports 2201 - 2210
  - ~~The default username configured in _docker-compose-expand.yml_ is "root"~~
  - The default username configured in is "root"
  - ~~The default password configure in the _docker-compose-expand.yml_ file is "root"~~
  - The default password is "root"

- Play with the example Ansible playbook

  - Launch Terminal from cloud dev env (Ctrl+Shift+`)

  ```bash
  cd ~/workspace/code/switch-ansible-example
  ansible-playbook --list-hosts -i inventory example-playbook.yml
  ansible-playbook -i inventory example-playbook.yml
  ```

## To Do

- [ ] Configure Gitea
  - **DEPRECATED.** Decided to use GitHub.
- [ ] Configure Jenkins
  - **DEPRECATED.** Decided to use Watchtower and Docker Hub, for simplicity and to give the User control and visability of the build and deploy process within their user env.
- [ ] Connect the E2E pipeline
  - **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Build lab scenarios
  - **IN PROGRESS.** Documenting and fixing issues and bugs.
- [x] Add cAdvisor, Prometheus and Grafana for observability
